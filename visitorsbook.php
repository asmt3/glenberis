	<h1>Visitor's Book</h1>

	<p>This is what some recent visitors had to say:<br>
	<br>
	Thank you for making our stay at Glenberis 100% perfect! It couldn't have been 
	any better. We look forward to coming back.<br>
	<br>
	You came highly recommended to us, now we can recommend you to others, for a 
	delightful tasteful home, really nice rooms, with every attention to detail and 
	requirements. It has been more like visiting a friend and we hope to visit again 
	very soon.<br>
	<br>
	A very nice home to come to and a really nice welcome. Graham, it has been a 
	pleasure to have your company and hope to see you again in the near future.<br>
	<br>
	Like being at a friend's house - comfortable, excellent breakfast, lovely house.<br>
	<br>
	Home from home as usual, lovely as usual.<br>
	<br>
	So good we had to stay another day! Wish it could have been longer, you are the 
	perfect host.<br>
	<br>
	This is our fourth visit. Thank you Graham for the first class service.<br>
	<br>
	Once again a lovely weekend. Nothing is too much trouble.<br>
